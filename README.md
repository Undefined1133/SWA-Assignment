Hey Ole, please don't bully me, i know this could be done much better and cleaner :D.

Yet i did most of the requirements, i have used inheritence but just in 1 use case, i have used both xml requests and fetch, 
anddd i displayed most of information that was requested.

I will be looking for a team though, to ease my life since that took some time...

In order to run the app all you need to do is ```run npm install``` and of course ``` node server.js ```



PS: There might be some trash here and there but yeah... my apologies ;p
